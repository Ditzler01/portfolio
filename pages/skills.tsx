                                I have been using MySQL for a very long time. I have learned MySQL during my term project
                                 in one of my subjects in school way back during my 2nd year college. MySQL is one of my go to

                                Firebase is one of the recent databases I have used during the time when I was learning
                                 mobile application development. It is very different from MySQL as it has a JSON format style
                                 and it is a realtime database

                                Flutter and Andriod Studio are the one I use to develop a mobile application. I started developing mobile application during my third

                                I have experienced creating an API using Java and MySQL during my second year college. I have learned the use of

                                 different web services such as Google Maps, Map Box and Steam to name a few.

                                I started learning Game Development as one of my hobby. I learned Unity Game Engine during the early days of
                                 COVID-19 and was able to finish some games. Game Development is difficult to learn aside from coding as 
                                 it is one of my specialty. Music/SFX, Arts, Ideas and Creativity are the skills that was improved
                                 while learning Game Development.

                                Selenium (C#) is the one I use to automate websites. Web Automation has a large similarity when it comes to
                                 web scraping. As soon as I learned web automation, learning web scraping is not so difficult for me. I explored
                                 this field when I was creating a trading bot in Steam.
